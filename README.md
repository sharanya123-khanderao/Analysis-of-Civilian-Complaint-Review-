# Analysis-of-Civilian-Complaint-Review-

How can the analysis of police complaint data be 
leveraged to enhance police practices, discipline, and community relations in New York 
City? 
This general inquiry includes the following particular goals: 
Finding Recurring Patterns in Police Reports: To guide targeted interventions, such as 
training programs or disciplinary procedures, ascertaining the most common categories of 
complaints, the recipients of complaints most frequently, and the temporal patterns in 
complaints.  
Development of Predictive Models for Future Complaints: Creating models that forecast 
which officers or departments are at higher risk of receiving complaints in the future. 
These predictive insights can enable proactive measures such as targeted training or 
support initiatives to mitigate potential issues before they escalate. 
Data Sources: The project will utilize the dataset from the Civilian Complaint Review 
Board (CCRB) of New York City, available at 
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Civilian-Complaint-Review-Board-Police-Officers/2fir-qns4/about_data 
Dataset contains 90.7k rows and 14 columns. 

The project approach: 
we will adopt a project approach inspired by the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard 
Process for Data Mining) framework, tailored to the specific context of analyzing police 
complaint data. This approach will guide us through the stages of understanding the 
business problem, preparing and analyzing the data, developing models, and deploying 
insights to improve policing practices and community relations.
